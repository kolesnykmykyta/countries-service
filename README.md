# Countries Service

## Description
This repository contains the simple class library that provides access to the information about the countries using [REST countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and unit tests for this library.

## Puprose of the project
This is the study project where I tried to improve my knowledge and skills on:

 1. Writing and designing the code according to the best practices and principles of the software development (for example, *SOLID*)
 2. Unit testing using ***xUnit*** and mocking using ***Moq***.
 3. Working with ***API*** using built-in .NET functionality.

## Plans
I plan to:

 1. Refactor code to make it better and more readable.
 2. Use the functionality of the created library in an application (probably, in the ASP.NET web app).
